	<h1>Our Mission</h1>

	The Reader’s Nook started in 2020 as a dream to provide underprivileged communities in Middlesex County with the benefits of knowledge and the joy of literature, one book at a time. We obtain books in good or fair condition through monthly fundraisers and donation drives. By connecting with local schools, households, and other groups with insufficient resources, we hope to bring enriching experiences directly to the people who lack reading programs and materials. Our growing team of volunteers devote time to speaking with individuals and administration alike about specific needs related to reading in their direct circles, and meet often to devise strategies tailored to our community.
