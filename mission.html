	<h1>Our Mission</h1>

	<p>
        The Readerâ€™s Nook started in 2020 as a dream to provide underprivileged communities in Middlesex County with the benefits of knowledge and the joy of literature, one book at a time. We obtain

        <a href="bookcategories.html">books</a>

        in good or fair condition through monthly fundraisers and donation drives. By 
        <a href="network.html">connecting</a>

        with local schools, households, and other groups with insufficient resources, we hope to bring enriching experiences directly to the people who lack reading programs and materials. Our growing 
        <a href="team.html">team</a>

      	of volunteers devote time to speaking with individuals and administration alike about specific needs related to reading in their direct circles, and meet often to devise strategies tailored to our community.
